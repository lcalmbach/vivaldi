**Comparison of Seasonal Data for the Swiss NBCN Weather Station Binningen, Switzerland**

Vivaldi is a data analysis tool designed to extract and compare seasonal weather data from the NSBN weather station in Binningen, Switzerland. The application retrieves daily weather data from the open data portal [data.bs](https://data.bs) and allows users to analyze seasonal trends, which is why itâ€™s aptly named after the famous composer known for "The Four Seasons."

You can try out the application online [here](https://vivaldi.streamlit.app/) or install it locally by following the instructions below.
